#  Match Case

# x = int(input("Enter the value: "));
# x is the variable to match
# match x:
    # if x is 0
    # case 0:
    #     print("x is zero")
    # # case with if-condition
    # case 4 if x % 2 == 0:
    #     print("x % 2 == 0")
    # # Empty case with if-condition
    # case _ if x < 10:
    #     print("x is < 10")
    # # default case(will only be matched if the above cases were not matched)
    # # so it is basically just an else:
    # case _:
